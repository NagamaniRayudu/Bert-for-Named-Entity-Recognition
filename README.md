# Named Entity Recognition with Bert

This note book follows the tutorial found at https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/named-entity-recognition-with-bert/ for NER classification using Bert

This notebook/tutorial will show you how you can fine-tune the Bert model to do state-of-the art named entity recognition (NER) in python with pytorch

you need to install the pytorch bert package by huggingface with:

pip install pytorch-pretrained-bert==0.4.0

Dataset: It uses the annotated dataset from kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus
